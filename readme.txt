= Settings =

Awesome Sticky Header by DevCanyon has long list of settings you can use to make your sticky header look the way you want.

= General =

These are general settings for your sticky header.

* **Sticky scroll position** - when will your sticky header show, after how many pixels scrolled down
* **Header width** - inner content (container) width, so your header stretches 100% of the browser window width, but logo and menus match your website's content
* **Full width stretch** - whether or not your header stretches 100% of the browser window width
* **Header position** - your header can also be placed left/right if your theme hasn't content middle oriented, just like Twenty Fourteen theme
* **Show description** - show/hide site description (tagline)
* **Sticky animation** - slide sticky header from top or appear without sliding animation
* **Hover transition** - transition effect for link hover colors or backgrounds

In Appearance -> Menus if your menu item has description, it will be whown in sticky header too.

= Header =

Detailed settings for main navigation, sub-menus, logo, tagline, etc.

* **Choose menu** - if you have created at least one menu under Appearance -> Menus, you can choose which menu will go to sticky header
* **Menu depth** - three levels of navigation for sub-menu
* **Logo image upload** - upload image to be used as your logo
* **Choose your logo type** - logo can also be text link; if it's image, you can set max. width for it
* **Menu padding (top/bottom)** - decide how big is your sticky header by putting padding on top/bottom for main menu items
* **Logo padding (top/bottom)** - same as above but top/bottom extra space for logo/description
* **Menu position** - you can have menu centered; this way logo is centered too, above menu
* **Menu items padding (left/right)** - left/right distance of menu items - don't put them too close! ;)
* **Background image URL** - choose background image for your sticky header and/or set repeat pattern (e.g. repeat-x)
* **Background color** - choose background solid color
* **Site title color** - color of your logo if it's set as text type instead of image
* **Site description color** - color for your description text under logo (if enabled in general settings)
* **Menu color** - color for menu items
* **Site title font size** - font size for your site title if it's set as text type instead of image
* **Site description font size** - font size for your description text under logo (if enabled in general settings)
* **Menu font size** - font-size for menu items/sub-menu
* **Menu item hover background color** - main menu item's background color on hover effect
* **Top border** - top border color of sticky header; you can set width in pixels for it
* **Bottom border** - bottom border color of sticky header; you can set width in pixels for it
* **Hamburger icon color** - this plugin has ability to hide your menu on small screens and show this icon - set color for it; when it's clicked, menu is shown as drop-down
* **Hide menu if narrower than** - decide at which screen width your menu hides (becomes responsive)
* **Include search box** - at the end of menu you can have search icon which expands search form on hover
* **Include secondary menu** - true or false; secondary menu is additional menu which is seen as last menu item, which on hover displays one more menu (and can show more, which is doable through filters)
* **Choose secondary menu** - which menu goes as secondary
* **Sub-menu background color** - background color for the whole sub-menu
* **Sub-menu item hover background color** - hover color effect for sub-menu items
* **Sub-menu orientation** - your sub-menu items can expand to left side too!


= Custom CSS =

Add your own styles, such as margins, paddings, borders, etc.
This is NOT custom CSS for the whole website, only for sticky header.

= Extras =

Some more featues will go in here!

* **Sub-menu transparency level** - background transparency for sub-menu (value range is from 0 to 100)
